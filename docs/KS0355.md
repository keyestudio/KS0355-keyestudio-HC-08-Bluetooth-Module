## 5. AT Command Settings

Before setting the AT command, for hardware, you need a USB to serial module (such as FT232 module) and several DuPont lines. For software, need a serial port assistant software, and install well the driver for the USB to serial module.

First, connect the Bluetooth module to FT232 module using DuPont line. The connection method is as follows.

| HC-08 Bluetooth Module | FT232 module |
| ---------------------- | ------------ |
| 5V                     | VCC（5V）    |
| GND                    | GND          |
| TX                     | RX           |
| RX                     | TX           |

Connected well, then connect the FT232 module (drive installation completed) to the computer using a USB cable.

First right-click the computer, for **properties** ->**Device Manager** to find the corresponding COM port. Then open the serial port assistant software, set the COM port, and the baud rate (initial default 9600).

After the connection is successful, you can start to set the AT command according to the instructions.

**11.Inquire and set the module whether connectable**

| Command   | Response                       | Instruction                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AT+CONT=x | OK/Connectable/Non-Connectable | Set the connectability. Non-connectable is mainly used for broadcast data. |

Send: AT+CONT=? Return: Connectable(query result “connectable”)
Send: AT+CONT=1 Return: OK (set the “Non-connectable” successfully)

The functions of parameter **x** is as follows:

| Parameter    | Master                                                       | Slave                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0（default） | （Central） Connectable, enter the normal transmission mode after connection. | （Peripheral） Connectable, enter the normal transmission mode after connection. |
| 1            | （Observer） The current module cannot connect to other modules or devices, but it will automatically scan the broadcast packet of HC-08 slave and refresh once per 2s. | （Broadcaster） cannot connect to the host, but it can be combined with low power mode 1 for broadcast packet transmission. |

Please usewith the "AT+MODE", "AT+AVDA" and "AT+AINT" instructions to reach the best results.

**1.** For the Master/Slave, CONT=1 is used to transmit the broadcast data. The Slave sends the broadcast data, and the Master receives the corresponding broadcast data and outputs it through the serial port.

**2.** This mode is only for the HC-08 module, or for those users who have Android development capabilities and can grab this packet themselves.

**12.Update broadcast data instruction (only set by Slave )**

| Command     | Response | Instruction            | Details                                                      |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AT+AVDA=xxx | OK       | Set the broadcast data | **1.** The parameter "xxx" can be any user data of 1~12 bytes. If the Master status AT+CONT=1 at this time, the Master serial port will output xxx data. This broadcast data will not be saved permanently and will expire after the module is restarted. <br>**2.** Since the Master is fixed for 2s scanning, the broadcast data received from the same Slave can be output only once in 2s. Moreover, this mode is characterized by "continuous broadcast from the Slave and continuous scanning by the Master", so the Master will continuously output data. <br>**3.** The higher the broadcast density of the slave, the easier the data is received by the Master. The higher the broadcast density, the higher the power consumption of the Slave. |

Send: AT+AVDA=1234567890AB Return: OK

If at this moment, for Master, AT+CONT=1, and successfully scan the broadcast from the Slave, the serial port will output: 1234567890AB

**13.Inquiry and modify the power consumption mode (only set by Slave )**

| Command   | Response                       | Instruction                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| AT+MODE=x | OK/Connectable/Non-Connectable | Set the power consumption <br>**Note:** only set by Slave |

Send: AT+MODE=? Return: 0/1/2 Send: AT+MODE=1 Return: OK

The functions of parameter **x** is as follows:

| parameter | Return | Explanations                                                 |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ?         | 0/1/2  | Gain the current power consumption mode                      |
| 0         | OK     | Full power consumption mode（factory default）               |
| 1         | OK     | Primary energy saving mode. Before connection, the current is determined by the setting of AT+AINT. After connection, mainly determined by AT+CINT. The MODE1 already covers the MODE3 of V2.4 version, and more reasonable! |
| 2         | OK     | Secondary energy saving mode (sleep mode). The current during sleep is 0.4μA. It can't be found and can't be connected during sleep. It can be found and connected after activatedby the serial port. |

**Note:** **1.** Power consumption mode 1 is mainly used for:

A. The main low-power mode of module, can provide low-power standby for transparent transmission, and can also be used as low-power broadcast data.

B. The Slave broadcasts data to the Master, supporting one-to-many single communication (in theory, one slave can send to an unlimited number of master. If you want to receive more data from slave, it is recommended to set a high baud rate).

C. For wireless reading devices such as anti-lost device, check-in card, heart rate meter, etc.

**2.** Power mode 1 and mode 2 can be activated by sending more than 1 byte of data through the serial port, but the first few bytes of data may be garbled.

Therefore, it is recommended to send a 10-byte hexadecimal code "0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF" to wake up the module, avoiding the first few garbled bytes.

After that, the module works in full speed mode, and the serial port can send and receive data normally.

In the unconnected state, the module wakes up and enters full speed mode for 20 seconds (default, can be adjusted by AT command), and then returns to the original power mode.As long as the serial port has received data within 20 seconds, it will be re-timed.

If the module is connected, it will remain in full speed mode after waking up. It will return to the original power mode unless disconnection.

**14.Set the broadcast interval instruction**

| Command       | Response      | Instruction                | Details                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AT+SUUID=xxxx | OK+SUUID=xxxx | Query/set the service UUID | The general Bluetooth master (without display, difficult to manually select) has set the UUID filter search. In this case, only slaves with the same UUID can be searched. Default: FFF0 (that is 0xFFF0); The parameter must be in the range of 0~F. |

Input:AT + LUUID =? Return: OK+LUUID=FFF0 (query LUUID: FFF0)
Input: AT+LUUID=1234 Return: OK+LUUID=1234 (set LUUID)

**21.Inquiry and set the pass-through UUID instruction**

| Command       | Response      | Instruction                     | Details                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AT+TUUID=xxxx | OK+TUUID=xxxx | Query/set the pass-through UUID | This pass-through UUID must be correct in order to transmit and receive data properly. Default: FFE1 (meaning 0xFFE1); The parameters must be in the range of 0~F. |

Input: AT + TUUID =? Return: OK+TUUID=FFE1 (query SUUID: FFE1)
Input: AT+TUUID=1234 Return: OK+TUUID=1234 (set SUUID)

**22.Inquiry and set the automatic sleep time instruction**

| Command   | Response  | Instruction                        | Details                                                      |
| --------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AT+AUST=x | OK+AUST=x | Query/Set the automatic Sleep time | **?:** Query (default 20s, the shorter the time, the more power saving.) <br>**Setting range:** 1~300 (unit: s) In low power mode, if no operation after activating the module, it will return to the low power mode set by the user after x seconds. |

Input: AT+AUST=? Return: OK+AUST=20 (Query the automatic sleep time is 20S)
Input: AT+AUST=60 Return: OK+AUST=60 (Set the automatic sleep time to 60S)

**Note:** AUST defaults by 20 seconds. In the MODE1 low-power mode, since the mode is discoverable and connectable, AUST can be set to a minimum of 1 second to save power. If it is MODE2 low power mode, since this mode is undiscoverable and unconnectable, it is recommended to set AUST to 20 seconds or more to ensure that the module has enough time to connect with other Bluetooth master devices after waking up through the serial port.

## 7. Used With UNO R3 Control Board

**1.Description**

In the experiment, we don’t set the AT command for Bluetooth module, but directly use it together with UNO R3. Bluetooth is default by Slave, default baud rate to 9600. When using, first upload the test code to UNO R3, then connect the Bluetooth to UNO R3, use phone APP and Bluetooth module to achieve the communication function between your phone and UNO R3 control board.

**Note:** when using, must first upload the code to UNO board, then connect the Bluetooth module to UNO R3. Or else fail to compile the code.

**2.Wire it Up**

Connect the 5V pin to 5V, GND to GND, TX pin to RX (digital 0), RX pin to TX (digital 1).

**2.Upload the Code**

Download Resource : [Resource](./Resource.7z)

```c
int val; 
int ledpin=13;

void setup() 
{ 
    Serial.begin(9600);
    pinMode(ledpin,OUTPUT); 
} 

void loop()
{ 
    val=Serial.read(); 
    if(val=='a')
    { 
        digitalWrite(ledpin,HIGH); 
        delay(250); 
        digitalWrite(ledpin,LOW); 
        delay(250);
        Serial.println("keyestudio");
    }
}
```

## 8. Test Result

Upload the above code to UNO R3, then connect well the Bluetooth, powered up, you should see the red led on Bluetooth module flash.

Then click the APP icon of HC-COM![](media/image-20260115153058271.png),enter the device search, click the device HC-08 to connect the Bluetooth. Bluetooth connected, the red led on the module will always on.

Enter a letter “a” and click “Send”, you should see the character “keyestudio” appear on the APP.
